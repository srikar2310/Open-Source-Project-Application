#### Why You?
I have done a python programming course in my first semester and I am thorough with basic Object oriented Programming in python(I had written matrix and vector classes for my linal assignments just because I was too lazy to learn numpy). I have also used libraries like Numpy, Matplotlib and Pandas extensively in the last 2 semesters.

#### What inspires you to be a PM on the MPL Open Source Project in The Programming Club? What are your various commitments for the upcoming year? How do you plan to manage your time between them?
I want to have more experience with git and open source projects and I also like python programming. I want to learn how to write good pull requests. I want to know how a public library works and what to keep in mind while writing it.
PoRs: I am a coordinator of CnL Events and workshops(Shaastra). I am also applying to the SMAC project under math club. I am also trying for Inter IIT chess contingent but it I am not sure if I'll get selected. I am also trying to apply to math guild.
For CnL I will be mostly free and I dont think I will have to put in much time for it. Work will be more towards the end of November and December. Apart from this I think I can manage 2 projects. I am also not taking any elective courses this semester so that I can manage these PoRs.
